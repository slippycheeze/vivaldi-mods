# Modifications for Vivaldi browser

Mods I use or have used in [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/). Not all are by me — don't be surprised when you find here your mod. Some have a JS and a CSS part — if you don't know what this or that CSS mod does, try looking in the `js/` folder. Some of them may not work. ***I don't recommend you using any mod from the `css/_not_working_old_etc/` folder.***

If you don't know how to apply them, follow [this tutorial](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi).

*Tip: If you have multiple profiles/installations and want to use different CSS mods, you can (at least in Linux) create links instead of copying files — thanks to this you have all profiles up to date with the main mods folder.*
